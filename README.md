**Dota 2 - Camera Lock Macro**

---

### Overview

This Python script provides a convenient solution for automatically locking the camera on a character in Dota 2 by pressing the "b" key.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pynput library
- win32api and win32con modules

### Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```
    pip install pynput
    ```

### Usage

1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.

    ```

3. Once the script is running, simply press the "b" key to activate the camera lock feature.

### Note

- This script is specifically designed to work on Windows operating systems.
- The default key to trigger the camera lock is "b", but you can customize it by modifying the `favorite_key` variable in the script.
- Adjustments to the `sleep_a` and `sleep_b` variables may be necessary depending on the application or game you are using the macro with.
